# Garden-Project


<!-- Why are we doing this? -->
<!-- To gain practical experience of writing code for an API - end to end>


<!-- How I expected the challenge to go>
<!-- Before we got the brief I was apprehensive but immediately afterwards I was relatively confident I had the knowledge and experience to make a decent go of it>

<!-- What went well?>
<!-- The backend code was relatively straghtforward as we'd had a lot of practice with that element and had practical examples we could refer to if I got stuck. This was borne out in practice and I had a working back end connected to the db and Postman by just after lunchtime on Friday>

<!-- What didn't go as planned?>
<!-- I expected the JS and HTML to be quite straightforward. For the most part this was true but I ended up needing help from Cameron to write the READ method.  I did add Bootstrap to my project but I struggled a bit to apply my own CSS file and make it work>

<!-- Improvements for next time>
<!-- I'd like to have more time to style the pages better and also apply SOLID principles more rigorously.  I felt there was some repetition of code in the HTML and JS. I'd also like to be able to make sure the output starts at the right point on the page>
